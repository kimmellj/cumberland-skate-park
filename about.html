    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>To provide a safe, inclusive, and supportive space where youth and community members can gather, grow, and thrive
        through skating and related activities.</p>
    <h3>Our Vision</h3>
    <p>A Cumberland where every young person has access to recreational opportunities that inspire self-expression,
        resilience, and positive community connections.</p>
    <h3>Who We Are</h3>
    <p>The Cumberland Skatepark Association (CSA) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit formed to support the development,
        programming, and long-term sustainability of the Cumberland Skatepark. What began as a grassroots effort by
        local advocates has evolved into a formally organized community initiative—recognized and supported by the City
        of Cumberland and fueled by the energy of local skaters, parents, artists, and community leaders.</p>

    <p>CSA serves as the structured leadership body for the skatepark, managing:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Fundraising and grant development</li>
        <li>Community partnerships</li>
        <li>Events, competitions, and programming</li>
        <li>Equipment access and youth outreach</li>
        <li>Long-term stewardship and youth leadership initiatives</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We are committed to removing barriers and increasing access to recreation, especially for underserved youth and
        marginalized communities.</p>

    <h3>Our Structure</h3>
    <p>CSA is guided by a diverse Board of Directors with lived experience, local roots, and a shared passion for youth
        wellness, skate culture, and community transformation.</p>

    <p>Board-led Committees help oversee programming, fundraising, communications, and equity.</p>

    <p>Youth and community members are invited to join committees, volunteer teams, and seasonal events.</p>
