        The Cumberland Skatepark Association (CSA) is a community-powered nonprofit dedicated to building a safe,
        inclusive,
        and thriving space for skating, connection, and youth development in Cumberland, Maryland.
    </p>

    <p>
        We believe every young person deserves access to creative outlets, outdoor recreation, and supportive
        communities.
        The skatepark is more than concrete, it’s a launchpad for confidence, wellness, and belonging.
    </p>

    <p>
        Whether you skate, bike, or simply cheer from the sidelines, you belong here. Join us in creating a space where
        everyone can gather, grow, and thrive.
